# Tile Map in a Terminal

![tile map game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mishalzaman/terminal-rpg-ruby/master/rpg-tile.png)

Learning Ruby and decided to create a game sort of thing on a terminal. All this application does is display a
map which is read from a JSON file. The map has some basic collision detection with a player character (Pr) that
can move around it.

In the future I will add other features to it, such as having a purpose. Ha!

Anyway check it out, fork it. Let me know how I can improve my Ruby code.

## Setup

Ruby v2.3.1 (Using Rbenv to manage Ruby versions)

To run the game, cd in the directory and ...

    ruby Game.rb

I tested this on a mac. It should work in a Windows Environment, but might be a bit slow. I only tested on a windows VM, so that could it?
